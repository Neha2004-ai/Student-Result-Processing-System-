🎓 Student Result Processing System
📝 Objective
Build a MySQL-based system to manage student grades, GPA/CGPA calculation, and generate result summaries including rank lists and pass/fail reports.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Database: MySQL 

Core SQL Features:

Table Design & Foreign Keys

Aggregate Functions

Conditional Logic (CASE)

Triggers

Window Functions (RANK)

Grouping and Joins

📌 Mini Guide
1️⃣ Design Schema
Create the following essential tables:

Students: Holds student information

Courses: Contains course names and credits

Semesters: Identifies the semester of enrollment

Grades: Records student marks, GPA, and grade per course

2️⃣ Insert Sample Data
Populate tables with mock or real student, course, and exam data using INSERT statements.

3️⃣ GPA and Pass/Fail Queries
Write SQL queries to:

Calculate GPA:

sql
Copy
Edit
GPA = SUM(gpa * credits) / SUM(credits)
Count passed/failed courses using CASE statements

Assign letter grades based on marks using CASE

4️⃣ Rank List Using Window Functions
Use RANK() or DENSE_RANK() to generate semester-wise rank lists:

sql
Copy
Edit
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY semester_id ORDER BY GPA DESC)
5️⃣ Add Triggers for GPA Calculation
Create a BEFORE INSERT trigger to automatically assign:

GPA based on marks

Letter grade (A+, A, B, etc.)

6️⃣ Export Semester-wise Result Summaries
Use queries to produce:

Student-wise GPA summary

Course-wise performance

Semester-wise comparison
Export using:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE 'results.csv';
📦 Deliverables
✅ SQL Schema: Tables with primary and foreign keys

✅ Data Insertion Scripts: Sample students, courses, grades

✅ GPA & Grade Logic: Case-based GPA assignment

✅ Pass/Fail Statistics: SQL queries with counts

✅ Rank List Query: RANK() window function

✅ Trigger: Auto GPA/grade assignment on insert

✅ Semester Summary Queries: GPA/CGPA and export-ready reports

🔚 Future Enhancements
📜 Add attendance and internal marks

🧾 Generate full report cards (PDF/HTML)

🌐 Build a front-end with PHP/React

🗂️ Add cumulative CGPA logic across semesters
